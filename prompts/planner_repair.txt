Your previous response was not valid JSON or did not match the required Step schema.

{{error}}

## Your previous output

{{previousOutput}}

## Instructions

Fix the JSON so it is a valid array of Step objects. Follow the exact schema rules from the original prompt. Respond with ONLY the corrected JSON array — no explanation, no markdown fences.

Remember: valid strategies are ONLY testid, role, text, css. Every step needs a description field.
