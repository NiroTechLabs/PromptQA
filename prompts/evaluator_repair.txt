Your previous response was not valid JSON or did not match the required evaluation schema.

## Validation error

{{error}}

## Your previous output

{{previousOutput}}

## Instructions

Fix the JSON so it matches this exact schema:

```
{
  "result": "PASS" | "FAIL" | "UNCERTAIN",
  "confidence": <number between 0 and 1>,
  "reason": "<non-empty string>"
}
```

Respond with ONLY the corrected JSON object — no explanation, no markdown fences.
